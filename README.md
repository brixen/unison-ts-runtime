# TypeScript Runtime for the Unison Programming Language

The [Unison programming language](https://www.unison-lang.org) rethinks many of
the fundamental ideas used to write programs in a networked age.

Ideally, a web browser would be no different than any other networked
computation resource, thereby unifying "frontend" and "backend" development
under the Unison model where code is content addressable and a particular
computation can be "moved" to another compute resource.

This project is an experimental attempt to define a runtime in TypeScript that
will just-in-time transpile Unison code to JavaScript that is run natively in a
browser. The runtime should include all of the Unison machinery that is needed
to obtain and run arbitrary Unison code within the constraints dictated by the
browser runtimes.
